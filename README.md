This example demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce` function in Swift with an array of strings.  The '+' operator is overloaded and can represent both integer addition and string concatenation. When reducing an array of strings with an initial value of 0 (an integer), the compiler cannot infer the correct operator to use, leading to a compilation error. The solution involves explicitly specifying the type of the accumulator and using the appropriate function for string concatenation.
